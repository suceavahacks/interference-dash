# interference-dash

A Geometry Dash–style rhythm runner where energy drinks increase speed and score, but generate signal interference that destabilizes the level. 
On the left is the apocalypse and you have to run from it. On the right is Rosen Shingle Creek from Orlando. So basically you have to go to Rosen Shingle Creek before
the apocalypse gets you. Rosen is invincible.
